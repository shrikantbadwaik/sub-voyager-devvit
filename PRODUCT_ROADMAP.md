## Overview

### Vision Statement

SubVoyager transforms Reddit communities into vibrant exploration platforms where travelers and locals discover, share, and complete micro-expeditions—hidden gems, photo spots, food hunts, cultural rituals, and off-beat routes. Through gamification and user-generated content, we create a sense of adventure within the Reddit ecosystem.

### Target Audience

- **Primary**: Urban explorers, travel enthusiasts, locals seeking new experiences
- **Geographic Focus**: Indian cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Jaipur, Bangalore, Pune) with global expansion potential
- **Reddit Communities**: r/IndiaTravel, r/Mumbai, r/Delhi, city-specific travel subreddits

### Unique Value Proposition

While many Reddit apps focus on quizzes and challenges, SubVoyager uniquely combines:

- Real-world exploration with digital engagement
- Map-based discovery
- User-generated expedition content
- Gamification with meaningful rewards
- Community building through shared experiences

expeditions:approved               → Hash of approved expedition IDs
expeditions:city:{city}            → Hash of expedition IDs by city
expeditions:tag:{tag}              → Hash of expedition IDs by tag

user:{username}                    → User profile JSON
user:{username}:unlocked           → Hash of unlocked expedition IDs
user:{username}:completed          → Hash of completed expedition IDs
user:{username}:created            → Hash of created expedition IDs
user:{username}:completion:{id}    → Completion details JSON

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Content quality**: Robust moderation, user reporting, quality guidelines
- **Monetization resistance**: Generous free tier, clear premium value

### Business Risks

- **Competitor apps**: Continuous innovation, community focus, unique features
